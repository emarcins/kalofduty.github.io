## My second miniGame for NocneRadio.pl 

There's a small game which is very similar to old retro games like Galaxian.
Game was written in vanilla.js and *works only on desktop (without Safari support).*
The language of the game is Polish. Use arrows (left and right) on your keyboard to move and spacebar to fire.

**Feel free to play and have fun!**
