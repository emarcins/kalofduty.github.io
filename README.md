## My second miniGame for NocneRadio.pl ðŸ“»

# What's this about?
There's a small game which is very similar to old retro games like Galaxian.

# Language and tools
Game was written in html, css and vanilla.js. The app *works only on desktop (without Safari support).*
<br />
There's also a css stack with a few animation.
# How it work?
The size of the window refers to size of the game. Hint: if you shrink the browser window game will be easier ;) 
The language of the game is Polish. Use arrows (left and right) on your keyboard to move character.


# Try the app!
**Feel free to play and have fun!** ðŸŽ®
