My second miniGame for NocneRadio.pl ðŸ“»
<br />

# What's this about?
There's a small game which is very similar to old retro games like Galaxian.
<br />
# Language and tools
Game was coding in html, css and vanilla.js. The app *works only on desktop (without Safari support).*
<br />
The code is written with using class (OOP) in a few files which are in folder "js".
There's also a css stack with a few animation.
<br />
# How it work?
The size of the window refers to size of the game. Hint: if you shrink the browser window game will be easier ;) 
The language of the game is Polish. Use arrows (left and right) on your keyboard to move character (one of listener of NocneRadio).
There is a two kinds of enemy. Bigger objects are stronger and you need 3 missiles to destroy them. You can destroy smaller objects using just a 1 missile.
Your character has an infinite number of bullets.
You have only 3 lives. The goal of the game is to gain as much points as it possible.
<br />
# Try the app!
**Feel free to play and have fun!** ðŸŽ®
